# The Python Synthesiser

This project is a simplified recreation of the JUCE plugin processor, to make prototyping plugins ideas easier. So far, the files are created for offline use.

The project settings can be found in `main.py`. These include `SAMPLE_RATE`, `BLOCK_SIZE`, and `TIME_IN_SECONDS`.

The audio processing happens in the `AudioProcessor` class, found in `AudioProcessor.py`.
